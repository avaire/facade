# The API keys is a set of API keys with their individual limit,
# users can send requests to the API by adding the token to
# the "Authorization" header.
#
# The token limit is calculated every minute, so a limit of 5 will
# allow the token 5 requests per minute, tokens with a limit of
# -1 will be exempt of these checks and can continue making
# requests as long as the token is provided.
